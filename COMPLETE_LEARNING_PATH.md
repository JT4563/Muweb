## 🏗️ **PHASE 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) - Understanding the Basics**

### **🤔 Before We Start: What is Backend Development?**

**Think of a restaurant:**
- **Frontend** = The dining room (what customers see and interact with)
- **Backend** = The kitchen (where all the cooking/processing happens)
- **Database** = The pantry (where ingredients/data are stored)
- **API** = The waiter (carries orders from dining room to kitchen and food back)

**Your CodeCrafter project is like a complete restaurant with:**
- Kitchen staff (controllers)
- Recipes (business logic)
- Storage systems (database)
- Communication systems (APIs)
- Security guards (authentication)

### **Step 1: Project Structure & File Relationships**

#### **🔗 How Files Are Connected (Like a House Blueprint)**

**Think of your project like a house - each folder has a specific purpose:**

```

#### **🔍 Simple Analogy: How These Files Work Together**

**Imagine ordering food through an app:**

1. **You tap "Order Pizza" (Frontend)**
2. **api/orders.routes.js** receives your request (like the restaurant phone)
3. **controllers/orders.controller.js** processes your order (like the order taker)
4. **models/order.model.js** structures how your order is saved (like the order form)
5. **services/payment.service.js** handles payment (like the payment processor)
6. **config/db.config.js** saves your order to database (like the kitchen gets the order)
7. **workers/kitchen.worker.js** makes your pizza in background (like the cook)
8. **websocket/tracking.js** sends you live updates (like "Your pizza is ready!")

**Every file has a specific job, just like every person in a restaurant!**

#### **🧠 Learning Task 1: Trace a Request Flow (Like Following a Letter Through the Post Office)**

**Goal**: Understand how a user request flows through your application

**🏃‍♂️ Imagine you're sending a letter - here's the journey:**

```
USER REQUEST FLOW (Like Mailing a Letter):

1. 📬 User hits: POST /api/auth/login
   ↳ Like: You drop a letter in the mailbox
   ↳ The letter says: "Please log me in with username: john, password: secret123"

2. 🚀 app.js → receives request  
   ↳ Like: Main post office receives your letter
   ↳ app.js says: "I got a letter, let me check who should handle this"

3. 📂 api/auth.routes.js → routes to auth controller
   ↳ Like: Post office looks at address and says "This goes to Authentication Department"
   ↳ auth.routes.js says: "Any login request goes to auth controller"

4. 🎮 controllers/auth.controller.js → handles login logic
   ↳ Like: Authentication Department worker opens your letter
   ↳ Controller says: "Let me check if john exists and if password is correct"

5. 📊 models/user.model.js → validates against database
   ↳ Like: Worker looks in the filing cabinet for john's information
   ↳ Model says: "Here's the structure of user data and how to find it"

6. 🔧 config/db.config.js → database connection
   ↳ Like: The filing cabinet key that opens the user records
   ↳ Database says: "Here's john's real password hash: $2a$10$xyz..."

7. ✅ Response sent back to user
   ↳ Like: Worker sends you a reply letter saying "Login successful! Here's your access card (JWT token)"
```

**🔍 What to study (Step by Step for Absolute Beginners):**

**Step 1.1: Open `app.js` and understand every single line**
```javascript
// Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet!
const express = require('express');  // ← What is 'require'? What is 'express'?
```

**What is `require`?**
- Think of it like "borrowing tools from a toolbox"
- `require('express')` means "I want to use the Express.js tool"
- Express.js is like a "web server kit" that helps you build websites

**Step 1.2: Trace every `app.use()` line**
```javascript
app.use(helmet());        // ← Puts a security helmet on your server
app.use(cors());          // ← Allows websites to talk to your server
app.use(express.json());  // ← Helps server understand JSON data
```

**What is `app.use()`?**
- Think of it like "installing security checkpoints"
- Every request must pass through these checkpoints in order
- Like airport security: baggage check → metal detector → ID check

**Step 1.3: Follow the route definitions in `api/` folder**
```javascript
// In api/auth.routes.js
router.post('/login', authController.login);
```

**What does this mean?**
- `router.post` = "When someone sends a POST request..."
- `'/login'` = "...to the /login address..."
- `authController.login` = "...send them to the login function"

**What is POST?**
- Think of HTTP methods like different types of mail:
  - GET = "Please give me information" (like requesting a catalog)
  - POST = "Please process this information" (like submitting a form)
  - PUT = "Please update this information" (like changing your address)
  - DELETE = "Please remove this information" (like unsubscribing)

**Step 1.4: See how controllers import models**
```javascript
// In auth.controller.js
const User = require('../models/user.model');
```

**What does this do?**
- "Borrowing the User blueprint from the models folder"
- Like having the form template when you need to create or find users

**Step 1.5: Understand middleware order (SUPER IMPORTANT!)**
```javascript
app.use(helmet());        // 1st: Security check
app.use(cors());          // 2nd: Cross-origin check  
app.use(express.json());  // 3rd: Parse JSON data
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes); // 4th: Handle auth routes
```

**Why order matters:**
- Like a security checkpoint at an airport
- You must go through security BEFORE you can board the plane
- Helmet must run BEFORE routes to protect them
- JSON parsing must happen BEFORE controllers try to read request data

**🎯 Baby Steps Practice:**
1. **Open `app.js` and read it line by line**
2. **Google every function you don't understand** (helmet, cors, compression)
3. **Draw the flow on paper** with arrows showing how a request moves
4. **Use simple words** to explain what each line does

### **Step 2: Understanding app.js (THE BRAIN)**

#### **📖 What app.js Does (Explained Like You're 5):**

**Think of app.js as the MAIN OFFICE MANAGER of a big company:**
- When someone visits your website, they're like a customer walking into your office
- app.js is the receptionist who greets them, checks their ID, and sends them to the right department
- It also makes sure the office is secure and organized

```javascript
// Let's break down app.js line by line (ABSOLUTE BEGINNER LEVEL):

// 1. IMPORTING TOOLS (Like getting tools from a toolbox)
const express = require('express');     
// ↳ What is 'express'? It's like a website-building kit
// ↳ 'require' means "I want to use this tool"
// ↳ Think: "I need a hammer from my toolbox"

const cors = require('cors');          
// ↳ What is 'cors'? Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
// ↳ Simple explanation: Allows your website (frontend) to talk to your server (backend)
// ↳ Like: Allowing people from other buildings to visit your office

const helmet = require('helmet');      
// ↳ What is 'helmet'? Security protection for your server
// ↳ Simple explanation: Like putting a security guard at your office entrance
// ↳ Protects against hackers trying to break in

const compression = require('compression'); 
// ↳ What is 'compression'? Makes your website load faster
// ↳ Simple explanation: Like zipping a file to make it smaller
// ↳ Your server sends smaller data = faster loading

// 2. CREATING THE APP (Like setting up your office)
const app = express();
// ↳ This creates your web application
// ↳ Think: "Now I have an empty office building, let me set it up"

// 3. SECURITY SETUP (Like hiring security guards)
app.use(helmet());
// ↳ This puts on the security helmet
// ↳ What it does: Adds special headers to protect against attacks
// ↳ Like: Installing security cameras and alarms

app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true
}));
// ↳ This allows your frontend to talk to backend
// ↳ 'origin' = which websites are allowed to call your API
// ↳ 'credentials' = allows sending cookies/login info
// ↳ Like: Giving permission slips to trusted visitors

// 4. DATA PROCESSING SETUP (Like setting up mail sorting)
app.use(express.json({ limit: '10mb' }));
// ↳ What is 'express.json()'? Helps server understand JSON data
// ↳ What is JSON? A way to send data like: {"name": "John", "age": 25}
// ↳ 'limit: 10mb' = Don't accept files bigger than 10 megabytes
// ↳ Like: "Only accept letters, not huge packages"

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
// ↳ Helps server understand form data (like contact forms)
// ↳ 'urlencoded' = data that comes from HTML forms
// ↳ Like: Understanding different types of mail formats

// 5. COMPRESSION (Like using a vacuum bag for clothes)
app.use(compression());
// ↳ Makes all responses smaller and faster
// ↳ Like: Compressing air out of packages before shipping

// 6. RATE LIMITING (Like having a "no spam" policy)
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
app.use(limiter);
// ↳ Stops people from making too many requests
// ↳ windowMs = time window (15 minutes)
// ↳ max = maximum requests allowed (100)
// ↳ Like: "Each person can only visit 100 times in 15 minutes"

// 7. CONNECTING ROUTES (Like setting up departments)
const authRoutes = require('./api/auth.routes');
const sessionRoutes = require('./api/sessions.routes');
const executeRoutes = require('./api/execute.routes');

app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
// ↳ All requests to /api/auth/* go to auth department
// ↳ Like: "All login/register requests go to HR department"

app.use('/api/sessions', sessionRoutes);
// ↳ All requests to /api/sessions/* go to session department
// ↳ Like: "All meeting room requests go to Facilities department"

app.use('/api/execute', executeRoutes);
// ↳ All requests to /api/execute/* go to code execution department
// ↳ Like: "All programming requests go to IT department"

// 8. ERROR HANDLING (Like having a customer service department)
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
// ↳ When something goes wrong, this handles it gracefully
// ↳ Instead of crashing, it shows a nice error message
// ↳ Like: "If something breaks, apologize to the customer"
```

**🔗 HOW app.js CONNECTS TO OTHER FILES:**

```
REQUEST FLOW (Like Following a Letter Through Mail System):

1. 📬 USER SENDS REQUEST → app.js receives it
   ↳ Like: Customer calls your office

2. 🛡️ SECURITY CHECK → helmet(), cors() check safety
   ↳ Like: Security guard checks ID

3. 📝 DATA PARSING → express.json() reads the data
   ↳ Like: Receptionist reads the customer's request

4. 🚦 ROUTE DECISION → app.use('/api/auth', ...) decides department
   ↳ Like: Receptionist says "This goes to HR department"

5. 📂 ROUTE FILE → api/auth.routes.js takes over
   ↳ Like: HR department receives the request

6. 🎮 CONTROLLER → controllers/auth.controller.js does the work
   ↳ Like: HR employee processes the request

7. 📊 MODEL → models/user.model.js handles database
   ↳ Like: Checking the filing cabinet for records

8. ✅ RESPONSE → Result goes back through same path
   ↳ Like: Answer travels back to customer
```

**🎯 Learning Exercise (Baby Steps):**
1. **Open app.js in your code editor**
2. **Read each line slowly** and match it to explanations above
3. **Google what you don't understand**: "What is express.js?", "What is CORS?"
4. **Draw the flow on paper**: User → Security → Parsing → Routes → Controller
5. **Test with simple request**: Use Postman to send GET request to your API

**💡 Key Concepts to Master (Explained Simply):**

**🔧 Middleware (Like Assembly Line Workers):**
- **What it is**: Functions that process requests step by step
- **Real example**: Security guard → ID checker → Department router → Worker
- **In code**: `app.use(helmet())` → `app.use(cors())` → `app.use(express.json())`
- **Why important**: Each step prepares the request for the next step

**🌐 CORS (Like Passport Control):**
- **What it is**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Simple explanation**: Allows your website (frontend) to call your server (backend)
- **Real example**: Like allowing people from other countries to visit your office
- **Without CORS**: Browser blocks your frontend from calling your API
- **With CORS**: Browser allows the connection

**⏱️ Rate Limiting (Like Bouncer at a Club):**
- **What it is**: Prevents too many requests from same person
- **Simple explanation**: "Each person can only make 100 requests per 15 minutes"
- **Why needed**: Stops spam attacks and server overload
- **Real example**: Like ATM limiting how many withdrawals per day

**📦 Body Parsing (Like Mail Sorting):**
- **What it is**: Converts incoming data into JavaScript objects
- **express.json()**: Handles JSON data `{"name": "John"}`
- **express.urlencoded()**: Handles form data `name=John&age=25`
- **Why needed**: Server needs to understand different data formats

**🗂️ Routing (Like Office Directory):**
- **What it is**: Deciding which department handles which request
- **Pattern**: `app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes)`
- **Meaning**: "All /api/auth requests go to auth department"
- **Like**: Office directory saying "HR is on 2nd floor, IT is on 3rd floor"

### **Step 3: Understanding server.js (THE HEART)**

#### **📖 What server.js Does (The Startup Manager Explained for Babies):**

**Think of server.js as the MAIN POWER SWITCH of your entire house:**
- When you flip this switch, your entire house comes to life
- It turns on electricity, water, heating, internet - EVERYTHING
- Without server.js, your app is just dead code sitting on your computer

```javascript
// Let's break down server.js line by line (SUPER DETAILED):

// 1. IMPORTING REQUIRED TOOLS (Like gathering all tools before starting work)
const app = require('./app');
// ↳ What is this? Getting the app.js file we just set up
// ↳ Think: "I need my office setup (app.js) to start my business"
// ↳ app.js = the office setup, server.js = actually opening for business

const http = require('http');
// ↳ What is 'http'? The protocol that websites use to communicate
// ↳ Think: "I need the language that browsers and servers speak"
// ↳ Like: Needing English to talk to English-speaking customers

const socketIo = require('socket.io');
// ↳ What is 'socket.io'? Real-time communication tool
// ↳ Think: "I need a phone system for instant communication"
// ↳ Allows live chat, real-time updates, instant notifications

const connectDB = require('./config/db.config');
// ↳ What is this? Function to connect to database
// ↳ Think: "I need to connect to my filing cabinet (database)"
// ↳ Without database = no way to save or retrieve data

const connectRedis = require('./config/redis.config');
// ↳ What is Redis? Super-fast memory storage
// ↳ Think: "I need a super-quick notepad for temporary information"
// ↳ Used for caching, sessions, temporary data

const connectRabbitMQ = require('./config/rabbitmq.config');
// ↳ What is RabbitMQ? Message queue system
// ↳ Think: "I need a mailbox system for background tasks"
// ↳ Used when tasks take too long (like sending emails, processing files)

// 2. ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Like checking your office address and phone number)
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
// ↳ What is PORT? The address where your server lives
// ↳ Think: "My office is at building number 3000"
// ↳ process.env.PORT = production address, 3000 = development address

const NODE_ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
// ↳ What is NODE_ENV? Tells if you're testing or in real business
// ↳ 'development' = you're practicing/testing
// ↳ 'production' = real customers are using your app

// 3. CREATING THE SERVER (Like opening your office building)
const server = http.createServer(app);
// ↳ What does this do? Creates actual web server
// ↳ app = your office setup, server = the actual building
// ↳ Think: "Now I have a real building where customers can visit"

// 4. WEBSOCKET SETUP (Like installing a phone system)
const io = socketIo(server, {
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL || "http://localhost:3000",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  }
});
// ↳ What is WebSocket? Instant two-way communication
// ↳ Think: "Installing phones so customers can call instantly"
// ↳ cors = allowing calls from your website
// ↳ methods = types of calls allowed (GET = asking for info, POST = sending info)

// 5. WEBSOCKET EVENT HANDLERS (Like training your phone operators)
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('User connected:', socket.id);
  
  // ↳ What happens when someone connects?
  // ↳ Think: "When phone rings, operator says 'Hello, how can I help?'"
  
  socket.on('join-room', (roomId) => {
    socket.join(roomId);
    console.log(`User ${socket.id} joined room ${roomId}`);
  });
  // ↳ What is 'join-room'? User wants to join a specific chat room
  // ↳ Think: "Customer wants to join conference room 123"
  
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id);
  });
  // ↳ What happens when someone leaves?
  // ↳ Think: "When customer hangs up, operator notes they left"
});

// 6. STARTUP SEQUENCE (Like opening your business step by step)
async function startServer() {
  try {
    // Step 1: Connect to Database (Like opening your filing cabinet)
    console.log('🔌 Connecting to MongoDB...');
    await connectDB();
    console.log('✅ MongoDB connected successfully');
    // ↳ Why first? Need storage before accepting customers
    
    // Step 2: Connect to Redis (Like setting up quick notepad)
    console.log('🔌 Connecting to Redis...');
    await connectRedis();
    console.log('✅ Redis connected successfully');
    // ↳ Why second? Need quick storage for user sessions
    
    // Step 3: Connect to RabbitMQ (Like setting up mailbox system)
    console.log('🔌 Connecting to RabbitMQ...');
    await connectRabbitMQ();
    console.log('✅ RabbitMQ connected successfully');
    // ↳ Why third? Need background task system ready
    
    // Step 4: Start the server (Like opening doors to customers)
    server.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`🚀 Server running on port ${PORT} in ${NODE_ENV} mode`);
      console.log(`📊 Health check: http://localhost:${PORT}/health`);
    });
    // ↳ This is the moment your app becomes live!
    // ↳ Now customers can visit your website
    
  } catch (error) {
    // What if something goes wrong during startup?
    console.error('❌ Failed to start server:', error);
    process.exit(1); // Shut down completely
    // ↳ Like: "If I can't open my office properly, I won't open at all"
  }
}

// 7. GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN (Like closing business properly)
process.on('SIGTERM', gracefulShutdown);
process.on('SIGINT', gracefulShutdown);

function gracefulShutdown(signal) {
  console.log(`📴 Received ${signal}. Shutting down gracefully...`);
  
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('✅ HTTP server closed');
    
    // Close database connections
    mongoose.connection.close(() => {
      console.log('✅ MongoDB connection closed');
    });
    
    // Close Redis connection
    redis.quit(() => {
      console.log('✅ Redis connection closed');
    });
    
    process.exit(0);
  });
}
// ↳ What is graceful shutdown? Closing business properly
// ↳ Instead of suddenly turning off power, you:
//   1. Stop accepting new customers
//   2. Finish serving current customers
//   3. Save all important data
//   4. Turn off systems one by one
//   5. Lock the doors

// 8. START THE SERVER (Like actually opening for business)
startServer();
```

**🔗 HOW server.js CONNECTS TO OTHER FILES:**

```
STARTUP SEQUENCE (Like Opening a Restaurant):

1. 📋 server.js starts → "I want to open my restaurant"

2. 🏢 Imports app.js → "Let me get my restaurant setup"
   ↳ app.js = menu, tables, kitchen setup
   ↳ server.js = actually opening the doors

3. 🗄️ Connects to MongoDB → "Let me connect to my storage room"
   ↳ config/db.config.js handles this
   ↳ MongoDB = where all data is permanently stored

4. ⚡ Connects to Redis → "Let me set up my quick-access shelf"
   ↳ config/redis.config.js handles this
   ↳ Redis = super-fast temporary storage

5. 📬 Connects to RabbitMQ → "Let me set up my task management system"
   ↳ config/rabbitmq.config.js handles this
   ↳ RabbitMQ = handles background jobs

6. 📞 Sets up WebSocket → "Let me install my instant communication system"
   ↳ websocket/socket.server.js provides the logic
   ↳ WebSocket = real-time chat, live updates

7. 🚀 Starts HTTP server → "Now I'm officially open for business!"
   ↳ server.listen(PORT) = customers can now visit

8. 🔄 Handles requests → "Customers start coming in"
   ↳ Each request goes through app.js flow
   ↳ Routes → Controllers → Models → Response
```

**🎯 Learning Exercise (Step by Step for Beginners):**
1. **Open server.js and read each line with explanations above**
2. **Try starting your server**: `npm start` or `node server.js`
3. **Watch the console messages**: See the startup sequence happen
4. **Visit `http://localhost:3000`**: See if your server responds
5. **Stop the server**: Press Ctrl+C and watch graceful shutdown

**💡 Key Concepts to Master (Explained Like You're 5):**

**🏗️ HTTP Server (Like Building a Store):**
- **What it is**: The actual building where customers visit
- **app.js**: Interior design and layout
- **server.js**: Actually opening the doors
- **PORT**: Street address where customers find you

**🔌 Database Connections (Like Utility Connections):**
- **MongoDB**: Main storage room (permanent data)
- **Redis**: Quick-access shelf (temporary data)
- **RabbitMQ**: Message system (background tasks)
- **Why connect first**: Need utilities before opening

**📞 WebSocket (Like Phone System):**
- **What it is**: Instant two-way communication
- **HTTP**: Like mailing letters (request → response → done)
- **WebSocket**: Like phone calls (constant connection)
- **Use cases**: Live chat, real-time updates, notifications

**🔄 Event Loop (Like Restaurant Manager):**
- **What it is**: Node.js handles multiple customers simultaneously
- **Not like**: One cashier serving one customer at a time
- **Like**: One manager coordinating multiple tasks
- **async/await**: "I'll start this task and come back when it's done"

**🛡️ Error Handling (Like Safety Procedures):**
- **try/catch**: "Try to do this, if it fails, do that instead"
- **Graceful shutdown**: Closing business properly, not just turning off power
- **process.exit(1)**: "Something is so wrong, I must close immediately"

**🌍 Environment Variables (Like Business Settings):**
- **process.env.PORT**: Address where business operates
- **NODE_ENV**: Whether you're practicing or serving real customers
- **Why use them**: Different settings for testing vs. real business

## 🗄️ **PHASE 2: Database Layer (Week 3-4) - The Memory System**

### **Step 4: Database Configuration (config/db.config.js)**

#### **📖 MongoDB Connection Mastery:**
```javascript
// Your db.config.js explained:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');  // MongoDB Object Document Mapper (ODM)

// Connection string parts:
// mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name
const connectionString = `mongodb://${dbUser}:${dbPassword}@${dbHost}/${dbName}`;

// What this means:
// - dbUser: Database username for authentication
// - dbPassword: Database password
// - dbHost: Where MongoDB is running (localhost or cloud)
// - dbName: Your specific database name
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Install MongoDB locally** and create a database
2. **Use MongoDB Compass** to visualize your data
3. **Practice mongoose queries** in MongoDB shell
4. **Understand connection pooling** and why it matters

**💡 Key Concepts:**
- **ODM**: Object Document Mapper (translates JS objects ↔ MongoDB documents)
- **Connection Pooling**: Reusing database connections for performance
- **Schemas**: Blueprint for your data structure

### **Step 5: Data Models (models/ folder)**

#### **📊 Understanding Your Data Models:**

**models/user.model.js - User Management:**
```javascript
// User Schema breakdown:

---

## 🔧 **PHASE 4: Services Layer (Week 7-8) - The Organs**

### **Step 8: Business Services (services/ folder)**

#### **⚙️ Services Contain Your Core Business Logic:**

**services/session.service.js:**
```javascript
// Session service handles complex session operations:
class SessionService {
  async createSession(userId, title, language) {
    // Complex business logic for creating sessions
    // - Validate user exists
    // - Set up default permissions
    // - Initialize session state
    // - Create collaboration workspace
  }
  
  async addCollaborator(sessionId, userId, permissions) {
    // Add someone to collaborate on a session
    // - Check if user already exists
    // - Validate permission levels
    // - Update session collaborators
    // - Send notifications
  }
}
```

**services/jwt.service.js:**
```javascript
// JWT service handles token operations:
class JWTService {
  generateAccessToken(user) {
    // Create short-lived access token (15 minutes)
  }
  
  generateRefreshToken(user) {
    // Create long-lived refresh token (7 days)
  }
  
  verifyToken(token) {
    // Validate and decode JWT token
  }
}
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Understand the service pattern** (separation of concerns)
2. **Learn JWT concepts** (access tokens vs refresh tokens)
3. **Practice service composition** (services calling other services)

---

## 🐳 **PHASE 5: Docker & Containerization (Week 9-10) - The Isolation**

### **Step 9: Understanding Docker**

#### **📦 What Docker Does in Your Project:**
```dockerfile
# Your Dockerfile creates a CONTAINER for your app:
FROM node:18-alpine    # Base image (lightweight Linux + Node.js)
WORKDIR /app          # Set working directory inside container
COPY package*.json ./  # Copy dependency files
RUN npm install       # Install dependencies
COPY . .              # Copy your application code
EXPOSE 3000           # Tell Docker your app uses port 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]  # Command to start your app
```

**services/docker.service.js - Code Execution in Containers:**
```javascript
// Your Docker service creates SECURE containers for code execution:
class DockerService {
  async executeCode(language, code, stdin) {
    // 1. Create isolated container for the programming language
    // 2. Copy user's code into container
    // 3. Set security limits (memory: 128MB, CPU: 0.5, no network)
    // 4. Execute code safely
    // 5. Capture output/errors
    // 6. Clean up container
    // 7. Return results
  }
}

// Security features:
// - Read-only filesystem (can't modify system)
// - No network access (can't make external calls)
// - Memory limits (prevents infinite loops from crashing server)
// - CPU limits (prevents high CPU usage)
// - Timeout protection (kills long-running code)
```

## 🔄 **PHASE 6: Message Queues & Background Jobs (Week 11-12) - The Workers**

### **Step 10: RabbitMQ & Background Processing**

#### **📡 Why You Need Message Queues:**
```javascript
// Problem without queues:
User submits code → Server executes immediately → User waits 30 seconds → Server crashes if too many requests

// Solution with queues:
User submits code → Add to queue → Return immediately → Worker processes in background → Notify user when done
```

**config/rabbitmq.config.js:**
```javascript
// RabbitMQ setup:
const rabbitmqConfig = {
  createChannel: async () => {
    // 1. Connect to RabbitMQ server
    // 2. Create communication channel
    // 3. Set up error handling
    // 4. Return channel for sending/receiving messages
  }
}
```

**services/queue.service.js:**
```javascript
// Queue service manages job processing:
class QueueService {
  async publishJob(queueName, jobData) {
    // 1. Connect to queue
    // 2. Send job data to queue
    // 3. Job waits for worker to pick it up
  }
  
  async consumeQueue(queueName, handler) {
    // 1. Listen for new jobs
    // 2. When job arrives, call handler function
    // 3. Acknowledge job completion
  }
}
```

**workers/code.worker.js:**
```javascript
// Background worker processes code execution:
class CodeWorker {
  async processMessage(jobData) {
    // 1. Receive job from queue
    // 2. Extract code execution details
    // 3. Call Docker service to execute code
    // 4. Save results to database
    // 5. Notify user via WebSocket
    // 6. Mark job as complete
  }
}
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Install RabbitMQ** locally and access management UI
2. **Understand queue concepts**: producers, consumers, messages
3. **Learn about job retry logic** and error handling
4. **Practice with different queue patterns**: work queues, pub/sub
5. **Understand dead letter queues** for failed jobs

**💡 Key Queue Concepts:**
- **Producer**: Sends messages to queue
- **Consumer**: Receives and processes messages
- **Exchange**: Routes messages to appropriate queues
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Holds messages that failed processing
- **Acknowledgment**: Confirms message was processed successfully

---

## 🌐 **PHASE 7: Real-time Communication (Week 13-14) - The Voice**

### **Step 11: WebSocket & Live Collaboration**

#### **⚡ Understanding WebSocket Communication:**
```javascript
// HTTP vs WebSocket:
HTTP:     Client → Request → Server → Response → Connection Closed
WebSocket: Client ↔ Persistent Connection ↔ Server (bidirectional, real-time)
```

**websocket/socket.server.js:**
```javascript
// WebSocket server handles real-time features:
class SocketServer {
  handleConnection(socket) {
    // When user connects:
    // 1. Authenticate user with JWT
    // 2. Join user to their session rooms
    // 3. Notify other users they joined
    
    socket.on('join-session', (data) => {
      // 1. Validate user has access to session
      // 2. Add user to session room
      // 3. Send current session state
      // 4. Broadcast to other users in session
    });
    
    socket.on('code-change', (data) => {
      // 1. Apply operational transformation (CRDT)
      // 2. Broadcast change to all session participants
      // 3. Update session in database
    });
    
    socket.on('cursor-move', (data) => {
      // 1. Broadcast cursor position to other users
      // 2. Update user's current position
    });
  }
}
```

**websocket/crdt.utils.js - Conflict Resolution:**
```javascript
// CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types):
// Solves the problem: "What happens when two users edit the same line simultaneously?"

class CRDTUtils {
  applyOperation(document, operation) {
    // 1. Transform operation based on concurrent operations
    // 2. Apply operation to document
    // 3. Ensure all users see the same final result
    // 4. No conflicts, no lost changes
  }
  
  // Example: User A types "Hello" at position 0, User B types "World" at position 0
  // Without CRDT: Final result is unpredictable
  // With CRDT: Final result is always "HelloWorld" or "WorldHello" (consistent)
}
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Build a simple chat app** with Socket.IO
2. **Understand WebSocket events** and rooms
3. **Learn about operational transformation** for collaborative editing
4. **Practice conflict resolution** scenarios
5. **Test with multiple browser tabs** to simulate multiple users

**💡 Key WebSocket Concepts:**
- **Rooms**: Group users for targeted messaging
- **Events**: Custom messages between client and server
- **Broadcast**: Send message to multiple users
- **Operational Transformation**: Algorithm for handling concurrent edits
- **CRDT**: Data structure that automatically resolves conflicts

---

## 📊 **PHASE 8: Monitoring & Observability (Week 15-16) - The Doctor**

### **Step 12: Prometheus & Grafana**

#### **📈 Understanding Your Monitoring Stack:**

**monitoring/prometheus.yml:**
```yaml
# Prometheus collects metrics from your application:
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'codecrafter-app'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']  # Your app
    metrics_path: '/metrics'         # Where metrics are exposed
    scrape_interval: 30s            # How often to collect data
```

**What Prometheus Collects:**
```javascript
// Your app exposes metrics like:
- http_requests_total{method="POST",route="/api/auth/login"}
- http_request_duration_seconds{method="GET",route="/api/sessions"}
- active_websocket_connections
- code_executions_total{language="python"}
- database_connections_active
- memory_usage_bytes
- cpu_usage_percent
```

**Grafana Dashboards:**
```javascript
// Grafana creates visual dashboards from Prometheus data:
- Request Rate: How many requests per second
- Error Rate: Percentage of failed requests
- Response Time: How fast your API responds
- Active Users: How many people are online
- Code Executions: Which languages are popular
- System Health: CPU, memory, disk usage
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Set up Prometheus** and explore the web interface
2. **Configure Grafana** and create your first dashboard
3. **Learn PromQL** (Prometheus Query Language)
4. **Create alerts** for critical metrics
5. **Understand SLIs and SLOs** (Service Level Indicators/Objectives)

**💡 Key Monitoring Concepts:**
- **Metrics**: Numerical data about your system (response time, error count)
- **Alerts**: Notifications when something goes wrong
- **Dashboard**: Visual representation of your system health
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement (what you promise users)
- **SLO**: Service Level Objective (internal goals)

---

## 🔧 **PHASE 9: Advanced Concepts (Week 17-18) - Becoming the Legend**

### **Step 13: Security Deep Dive**

#### **🔒 Understanding Your Security Layers:**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
```javascript
// JWT (JSON Web Tokens) flow:
1. User logs in with username/password
2. Server verifies credentials
3. Server creates JWT containing user info + expiration
4. Server sends JWT to user
5. User includes JWT in all future requests
6. Server verifies JWT on each request
7. If valid, process request; if not, reject

// middleware/auth.middleware.js:
const auth = (req, res, next) => {
  // 1. Extract JWT from Authorization header
  // 2. Verify JWT signature and expiration
  // 3. Decode user information from JWT
  // 4. Add user info to request object
  // 5. Continue to next middleware/controller
}
```

**Rate Limiting:**
```javascript
// Protection against abuse:
const rateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
  max: 100,                   // Maximum 100 requests per window
  message: 'Too many requests'
});

// Why this matters:
// - Prevents spam attacks
// - Protects against DoS (Denial of Service)
// - Ensures fair usage among users
```

**Input Validation:**
```javascript
// utils/validator.js protects against:
- SQL Injection: Malicious database queries
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Malicious JavaScript injection
- Buffer Overflow: Sending too much data
- Path Traversal: Accessing files outside allowed directories

// Example validation:
const validateEmail = (email) => {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email) && email.length <= 254;
}
```

### **Step 14: Performance Optimization**

#### **⚡ Making Your App Lightning Fast:**

**Database Optimization:**
```javascript
// Indexes speed up queries:
userSchema.index({ email: 1 });        // Fast user lookup by email
sessionSchema.index({ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 }); // Fast session listing

// Query optimization:
// Bad: User.find({}) - loads all users
// Good: User.find({}).limit(10).select('username email') - only what you need
```

**Caching with Redis:**
```javascript
// config/redis.config.js caches frequently accessed data:
const cacheKey = `session:${sessionId}`;
const cachedSession = await redis.get(cacheKey);

if (cachedSession) {
  return JSON.parse(cachedSession);  // Fast: from memory
} else {
  const session = await Session.findById(sessionId);  // Slow: from database
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(session));  // Cache for 5 minutes
  return session;
}
```

**Connection Pooling:**
```javascript
// Database connections are expensive to create
// Connection pooling reuses existing connections:
mongoose.connect(uri, {
  maxPoolSize: 10,     // Maximum 10 connections
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000  // Timeout after 5 seconds
});
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Performance test** your API with tools like Artillery or k6
2. **Analyze database queries** with MongoDB Compass
3. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed data
4. **Set up database indexes** and measure query performance
5. **Monitor memory usage** and optimize where needed

---

## 🏆 **PHASE 10: System Design & Architecture (Week 19-20) - The Architect**

### **Step 15: Understanding Distributed Systems**

#### **🌐 How Your Project Scales:**

**Horizontal Scaling:**
```javascript
// Current setup (single server):
Users → Load Balancer → Your App → Database

// Scaled setup (multiple servers):
Users → Load Balancer → [App1, App2, App3] → Database Cluster
                     ↘ [Worker1, Worker2] → Message Queue
```

**Microservices Architecture:**
```javascript
// Your project is already microservices-ready:
- Authentication Service (auth controller + JWT service)
- Session Management Service (session controller + service)
- Code Execution Service (execute controller + Docker service + workers)
- Real-time Communication Service (WebSocket server)
- Monitoring Service (Prometheus + Grafana)

// Each service can be:
- Deployed independently
- Scaled independently
- Updated without affecting others
- Owned by different teams
```

**Data Consistency:**
```javascript
// CAP Theorem: Choose 2 of 3:
// - Consistency: All nodes see the same data
// - Availability: System remains operational
// - Partition Tolerance: System works despite network failures

// Your project chooses:
// - Availability + Partition Tolerance (AP)
// - Eventually consistent (data syncs across nodes eventually)
```

### **Step 16: Deployment Strategies**

#### **🚀 Production Deployment Patterns:**

**Blue-Green Deployment:**
```javascript
// Two identical production environments:
Blue Environment: Current live version (v1.0)
Green Environment: New version (v1.1)

// Deployment process:
1. Deploy v1.1 to Green environment
2. Test Green environment thoroughly
3. Switch traffic from Blue to Green instantly
4. Keep Blue as backup for quick rollback
```

**Rolling Deployment:**
```javascript
// Gradual replacement of instances:
Server1: v1.0 → v1.1 ✓
Server2: v1.0 → v1.1 ✓
Server3: v1.0 → v1.1 ✓

// Benefits:
- Zero downtime
- Gradual rollout
- Easy rollback
```

**🎯 Learning Tasks:**
1. **Design system architecture** for 1 million users
2. **Plan deployment strategies** for zero-downtime updates
3. **Learn about load balancing** algorithms
4. **Understand database sharding** and replication
5. **Practice with Kubernetes** for container orchestration
