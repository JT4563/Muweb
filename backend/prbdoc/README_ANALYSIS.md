## 🤝 Getting Help

### If Redis methods are confusing

👉 Look at how they're called in:

- `controllers/auth.controller.js` (login flow)
- `websocket/socket.server.js` (user socket mapping)
- Study the expected behavior before implementing

### If Session methods are unclear

👉 Look at how they're used in:

- `controllers/sessions.controller.js` (all session operations)
- `websocket/socket.server.js` (participant management)
- Understand the permission model first

### If Dockerfile feels foreign

👉 Refer to the existing `docker-compose.yml`:

- See how other services are configured
- Follow the Node.js + Alpine pattern
- Study the healthcheck examples

### If tests are overwhelming

👉 Start with one simple case:

- Test user registration
- Expand from there
- Use Jest (already in package.json)

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Can I deploy this right now?**
A: No, not yet. Missing configurations and code will prevent deployment.

**Q: How long will fixes take?**
A: 14-20 hours for critical items, 36-52 hours total to production.

**Q: Should I fix issues in order?**
A: Yes, some items block others. Follow the CRITICAL_ACTION_ITEMS.md list.

**Q: Can multiple people work on this?**
A: Yes, but Redis config and Session model should be done by one person to avoid conflicts.

**Q: What if I find more issues?**
A: Document them in a new issue file and add to the end of the TODO list.

**Q: How do I verify each fix works?**
A: Check `CRITICAL_ACTION_ITEMS.md` for the verification checklist.

## 🎉 Conclusion

This is a **well-architected project** that's **70% complete**. With focused effort on the 9 critical items listed, you'll have a production-ready collaborative code execution platform within 1-2 weeks.

The technology choices are solid, the security posture is good, and the scalability is built-in. The main work remaining is connecting the last pieces and adding tests.

**You've got this! 🚀**
